BASIC:
1. user should guess letter
2.
3. if the guess is right, program should reveal the letter(s)
4. number of chances should be displayed and updated after each wrong guess
5. max number of guesses is 7 (turns)
6. if the user repates  previous wrong guessed letter, the program should notify the user,
    but do not count as missed chance
7. if the user guesses the word within 7 missed letter, he/she wins.

COMPLEX:
1. User is able to choose category of secret words: cars, movies etc
2. wrongly guessed letters should be notified and displayed in terminal

_________

- the program gets input()
- input is only string
- format of the word is shown as ___ ___ _ _ etc

_______________

- should have two themes - arrays: countries and food
- each array has 4 words

First user chooses theme.
Then program randomly chooses word from the theme and counts the number of letter in that word.
program displays “_” which will be equal to number of words. Example, cat >>>   _ _ _ and shows number of misses allowed (7).
Then program ask a user to make input - one letter, upper and lower case should work.

if user input exist in the word, the letter(s) is reveled instead of “_” in the position(s) of correctly guessed letter. if user guesses wrong, number of allowed misses decreases (6). and wrong letters are shown as well. Example: HAHA MISSED IT. YOU HAVE (6) chances. repeated misses are not count


Step1 - Greeting and asks for input >> choose theme (array). Each theme has 4 words
Step2 - it chooses random word from the theme (array) based on user input
Step3 - counts the chosen word’s letters
Step4 - prints out ” _ ” number times as the letters in the word and number of allowed tries (7)
Step5 -
